// function spawn car on certain road id 

// able to give a car a path 

// spawn( id:'roadId' where: 'start of the road')

// path ---

// car.dir.straght()

// in in car.dir.staright has functions that has animation for accelarting and declarting and if ends up on intersection slows down with ease and then keeps going 

// dir checks if car is at an intersection and return something, then maybe a new method can be called, like turn right

// each one of these methods has animation on how the car moves like i make it slowly accelrate, creep up a bit like its checking for on coming cars and more

// so for example, car spawns, i give it a path like straight left left stright.

// in car.turnLeft() has aniamtions for geiong into the right lane

// let there be function for simulating accelarations, also let these be able to be layers like rotateLeft and accelate.
