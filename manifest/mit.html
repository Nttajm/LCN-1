Dear [Applicant Name:first],
      </pre>
      <span class="name-insert">
      On behalf of the Admissions Committee, it is my pleasure to offer you admission to the MIT Class of [Applicant Class]. You were identified as one of the most talented and promising students in one of MIT’s most competitive applicant pools ever. Your commitment to personal excellence makes you stand out as someone who will thrive within our academic environment as well as contribute to our diverse community. At MIT, you join kindred spirits: scholars, builders, entrepreneurs, and humanitarians. We believe that you and MIT are very well matched for each other.      </span>
    </span>
    <span class="name-insert">
      You’ll have offers from many fine schools, but we hope that you’ll choose to enroll at MIT. The deadline to accept our offer is May 1, and you’ll soon receive a reply form via postal mail. Between now and then, though, we look forward to building our relationship with you so you can get to know us better. Over the next several months, we’ll be in touch by email, over the phone and via your MyMIT portal account. If you have applied for financial aid, you’ll soon receive correspondence from that office as well. And <a href="#" class="dwn">click here for a list of local Admitted Student Parties</a>, happening all over the world.

      If you can’t come to CPW, please try to visit campus before May 1. To make arrangements to stay overnight with an undergraduate host, complete the online request form on the MyMIT website or just call the Office of Admissions at (617) 253-4791. If you are unable to visit the campus but are eager to get to know MIT, you’ll have the chance to speak with a current undergraduate soon; an MIT student will be calling you in April.

      I hope this letter is the one you were expecting and that it brings you the exhilaration you deserve to feel. I also hope that you will take the night off to celebrate with your loved ones. But as a mother, I expect you to get right back to work and finish up the year with top grades, since we don’t admit slackers to MIT and this offer of admission is contingent upon your successful completion of the school year. No senior slump allowed!
    </span>

    <span class="name-insert">
      Finally, I hope you’ll agree with us that MIT is the perfect place to prepare you for your future role in a world that badly needs you. Congratulations and welcome to the MIT Class of [Applicant Class]. I look forward to seeing you on campus.
    </span>

    <span class="">
      Sincerely,
    </span>
